#### (2) What are your strengths and weaknesses?

**Strengths**（选2-3个，举例说明）：
- **Technical proficiency**: "I have strong programming skills in Python 
  and have developed several hydraulic modeling tools..."
- **Analytical thinking**: "During my research, I successfully identified 
  and solved a complex numerical stability issue..."
- **Team collaboration**: "In our research group, I coordinated with 5 
  members and led the development of..."

**Weaknesses**（选1个，说明改进措施）：
- **Public speaking**: "I used to be nervous during presentations, but 
  I've been actively improving by..."
- **Time management**: "I sometimes focus too much on perfection. I've 
  learned to prioritize and set realistic deadlines..."

**示例**：

```
Regarding my strengths, I would say my strongest asset is my technical 
proficiency. I've developed strong programming skills during my graduate 
studies, particularly in Python and MATLAB. For example, I independently 
built a Python package for river network analysis, which has been adopted 
by our research group and downloaded over 500 times on GitHub.

Another strength is my problem-solving ability. In my thesis work, I 
encountered a challenging numerical convergence issue. After systematic 
analysis and testing different schemes, I successfully resolved it by 
implementing a hybrid finite volume method.

As for weaknesses, I'd say I tend to be overly meticulous sometimes, which 
can slow down my progress. However, I've been working on this by setting 
clear priorities and deadlines for each task. I've also learned to 
distinguish between situations that require perfection and those where 
"good enough" is acceptable.
```

#### (3) Describe a challenging project you worked on.

**STAR方法**（英文版）：
- **Situation**: Briefly describe the context
- **Task**: Explain your specific responsibility
- **Action**: Detail the steps you took
- **Result**: Highlight the outcomes and lessons learned

**示例**：

```
One of the most challenging projects I worked on was developing a real-time 
flood forecasting system for a small urban watershed.

**Situation**: The city had experienced several flash flood events, and the 
local government needed a reliable early warning system. The challenge was 
that the watershed response time was very short, only about 30 minutes.

**Task**: I was responsible for developing the hydrological model and 
integrating it with real-time rainfall data from weather stations.

**Action**: I took several steps to address this challenge:
1. I collected and analyzed 10 years of historical rainfall and flood data
2. I calibrated a distributed hydrological model using machine learning 
   techniques to improve prediction accuracy
3. I developed an automated data processing pipeline that could update 
   forecasts every 5 minutes
4. I implemented a web-based dashboard for emergency managers

**Result**: The system achieved 85% accuracy in flood peak prediction with 
a 45-minute lead time. It has been successfully deployed and has helped 
prevent property damage during two flood events last summer. This project 
taught me the importance of integrating theoretical knowledge with practical 
engineering requirements.

### 1.3 专业技术问题

#### (1) 水力学专业词汇

| 中文 | 英文 | 说明 |
|------|------|------|
| 明渠流 | Open channel flow | 自由表面流动 |
| 临界流 | Critical flow | Fr = 1 |
| 水跃 | Hydraulic jump | 急变流现象 |
| 比能 | Specific energy | E = h + v²/2g |
| 曼宁公式 | Manning equation | 均匀流计算 |
| 渐变流 | Gradually varied flow | GVF |
| 溃坝波 | Dam break wave | 非恒定流 |
| 渗透系数 | Hydraulic conductivity | 地下水 |
| 含水层 | Aquifer | 承压/潜水 |
| 频率分析 | Frequency analysis | 水文统计 |

#### (2) 技术问题示例

**Q: Explain the concept of Froude number and its significance in hydraulics.**

```
The Froude number is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the 
flow regime in open channel hydraulics. It's defined as:

Fr = v / sqrt(g*h)

where v is the flow velocity, g is gravitational acceleration, and h is 
the flow depth.

The significance of Froude number lies in distinguishing flow regimes:
- Fr < 1: Subcritical flow, where gravity forces dominate. Disturbances 
  can propagate both upstream and downstream.
- Fr = 1: Critical flow, occurring at minimum specific energy for a given 
  discharge.
- Fr > 1: Supercritical flow, where inertial forces dominate. Disturbances 
  can only propagate downstream.

This is crucial for hydraulic structure design, such as determining spillway 
types and energy dissipation requirements. For example, hydraulic jumps 
occur when supercritical flow transitions to subcritical flow.
```

**Q: How do you approach numerical modeling of unsteady flow?**

```
For unsteady flow numerical modeling, I typically follow these steps:

1. **Governing Equations**: Start with the Saint-Venant equations, which 
   consist of continuity and momentum equations for one-dimensional 
   unsteady open channel flow.

2. **Numerical Scheme Selection**: Choose an appropriate method based on 
   the problem characteristics:
   - For smooth transitions: MacCormack scheme (explicit, second-order)
   - For shock waves: Finite volume methods with Riemann solvers
   - For long-term simulations: Implicit schemes like Preissmann

3. **Stability Analysis**: Ensure the CFL condition is satisfied for 
   explicit schemes: Δt/Δx ≤ 1/(|v| + c), where c is the wave celerity.

4. **Boundary Conditions**: Properly specify upstream (discharge or stage) 
   and downstream (rating curve or stage) boundaries.

5. **Validation**: Compare results with analytical solutions or physical 
   model data to verify accuracy.

In my thesis, I implemented a hybrid finite volume scheme that successfully 
captured both gradual and abrupt flow transitions in a river network system.

## 二、跨文化沟通技巧

### 2.1 文化差异认知

**工作场所文化对比**：

| 维度 | 中国 | 西方（美国/欧洲） |
|------|------|------------------|
| 沟通方式 | 含蓄、间接 | 直接、明确 |
| 决策过程 | 层级化、自上而下 | 参与式、讨论为主 |
| 反馈方式 | 婉转、注重面子 | 直率、事实导向 |
| 时间观念 | 弹性、关系优先 | 严格、守时为重 |
| 团队协作 | 集体主义 | 个人主义 |

### 2.2 跨文化沟通策略

#### (1) 主动倾听（Active Listening）

**技巧**：
- 眼神接触：Show engagement
- 点头确认：Acknowledge understanding
- 提问澄清：Ask clarifying questions
- 总结复述：Paraphrase to confirm

**示例短语**：
```
- "If I understand correctly, you're saying that..."
- "Could you please elaborate on...?"
- "Just to clarify, do you mean...?"
- "That makes sense. Let me see if I've got this right..."
```

#### (2) 清晰表达（Clear Communication）

**PREP结构**：
- **Point**: 明确观点
- **Reason**: 给出理由
- **Example**: 举例说明
- **Point**: 重申观点

**示例**：

```
I believe we should adopt the finite volume method for this project.

The main reason is that our simulation involves shock waves and 
discontinuities, which finite volume methods handle better due to their 
conservative property.

For example, in a similar dam break simulation I conducted, the finite 
volume method captured the shock front more accurately than finite 
difference, with 15% less numerical diffusion.

Therefore, I recommend we implement a finite volume solver with an HLL 
Riemann solver for this application.
